# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

## Description

The What, Why, and How - Welcome to my personal portfolio! I had lots of fun created this website and though it needs improvements, I am very proud of what I've made. If you like the art my wife made it! Her artist skills continuously impress me.
I created this site as a sort of hub to house some of my current works and future projects. As my skills in this industry grow and develop this site will reflect that. This site was built with very basic html and css. With some flexbox thrown in there!

What was my motivation - I love doing what I do: computer programming! I seek to enter the industry and have a long list of websites and other programming related material that I can be proud of in my old age.

Why did I build this project - I built this project as sort of a station that will house some of my current work and future work. I look forward to filling this site with creative and insightful projects.

What problem does this project solve - This project as helped me familiarize myself with css. Thanks to this project I have a better handle on flexbox and making a web layout.

What did I learn - I learned how to look at a mock-up and style my page accordingly. I learned how to use flexbox to make content more appealing.

What makes this project stand out - This project stands out because it's my first website that I made from scratch. I am very pleased with the way this website turned out and I'm so so happy to share it with all of you!

ALSO A BIG THANK YOU AND SHOUT OUT TO MY WIFE FOR MAKING ME A CUSTOM AVATAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
